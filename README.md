# Doubly-Threaded-Binary-Tree
# I started with the bit fields because that seemed like the easiest thing to start with, and as it turns out, I needed to implement those first anyway.

# After the bit fields, I moved to inserthelp() because what good is printhelp() or any print for that matter without insert?  Finally, after an afternoon of dereferencing null pointers, inserthelp() was working with threads!

# Now I needed to get printhelp() working with threadsâ€¦ and that was easier than I expected.  Boom, on to the last two functions.

# I found printInOrder() to be very difficult, but I finally figured it out.  Lastly, I used the code from printInOrder() to program printReverse().

# Overall, I would say this lab was very, very challenging.  I really, really loved it though.  I love a good challenge.
